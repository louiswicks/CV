## Louis Wickremeratne

My biggest weaknesses is my indecision. When it comes to large judgements about my personal life I often struggle to act quickly, where logic lacks it takes me time to weight out my options. This has partly been the case during my short (albeit just starting) professional career. After university, I was extremely keen on getting started in the professional world and claiming some responsibility. I was very fortunate to work as part of two commerical teams at great organisations (W Series and the Aleto Foundation). We had great commercial success, generating high quality leads, cultivating healthy sales pipelines and helping these companies grow by increasing their operating incomes.

However, at both these opportunities I felt the work was lacking something. I realised I had rushed into these jobs and not fully understood the type of work I loved. It was looking back at what I loved at school, this was problem solving. 

And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.
